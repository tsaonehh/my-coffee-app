# my-coffee-app
This is an HTML focused app, 
with a bit of CSS of course for style.
Because I love coffee so much, especially
iced-coffee, I decided to work on 
an app with all coffee places in my
area and I will be showing aesthetics
as well because that's very important
to me. 
Afterall we taste with our eyes
first. This app also makes use of
multiple pages and navbars which always
make an app to look more sophisticated.
This is also for all coffee lovers out there.
