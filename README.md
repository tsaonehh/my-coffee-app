# my-coffee-app
This is an HTML focused app, 
with a bit of CSS for style.
Because I love coffee so much, especially
iced-coffee, I decided to work on 
this app to add all coffee places in my
area and I will be showing aesthetics
as well because that's very 
important to me. 
Afterall we taste with our eyes
first. 
I will also include some reviews 
and contacts so you know where 
to get the best of the best.
This app also makes use of
multiple pages and navbars which always
make an app to look more sophisticated.
This is also for all coffee lovers out there - a worthy list!
